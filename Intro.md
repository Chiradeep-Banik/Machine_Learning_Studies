# Machine Learning 

## Why do we need machine learning 
- Database mining 
    - as the products keep rolling out the user database keeps growing so to taylor it we need to process the huge amount data
          this is where machine comes to deal with huge datasets.
- Self Imroving code
    - Movie or product recommendation system
- Fundamental analysis of the human brain
- Things that we can't do
    - Self controlling vaccum clearer
    - Self Driving cars

## What is machine learning 
- When an algorithm can learn to do something without being explisitly programmed to do so it is machine learning.
- If an algo does some task T , to gain some experience E and improve at a performance matrix P in doing the task T after some experience E. -> it is machine learning

### Types of machine learning algorithms 
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Rienforcement Learning
- Recommender System

#### SuperVised Learning
    This type of learning is used when we have a set of features and lables. So, that we can model a algorithm to predict future lables from only features.
Generally supervised learnig can be used to solve these problems 
- Regression Problem : When we need to predict a continuous value
- Classifiction Problem : When we need to classify a feature into discrete number of outcomes
- others

#### UnsuperVised Learning
    This type of learning is generally used when we only have a dataset consisting of only features, we don't have any idea about how the lables look like.
Generally they are 
- Clustering : when we just seperate data based on their charecteristics
- Pattern recognition 
- others
